# Changelog

All notable changes to Draft Bench are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). For Draft Bench's plugin-specific versioning rules (what counts as breaking, when 1.0 ships, BRAT vs. Community Plugins), see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- All Draft Bench context-menu actions now appear under a single `Draft Bench` submenu (icon `scroll-text`) instead of cluttering the top level of Obsidian's right-click menu. On mobile (where Obsidian doesn't yet support submenus), items appear as a flat list with `Draft Bench:` prefixes. Smart visibility carries through unchanged: the submenu only appears when at least one action would change something. Refs #5.
- Folder-scope `Set as project` is now smart about the folder-note convention. Previously, right-clicking a project folder and picking `Set as project` would batch-stamp every markdown file inside (including scenes) as a project. The action now only appears when the folder contains an untyped markdown file matching the folder's name (case-insensitive), and stamps only that file. Other folder-scope retrofits (`Set as scene` / `Set as draft` / `Complete essential properties` / `Add identifier`) keep their batch behavior since their semantics naturally apply across all markdown children. Refs #3.

### Added

- `editor-menu` registration: right-clicking inside an open editor now surfaces the same Draft Bench actions as the file-explorer right-click, scoped to the active note. Refs #5.

### Fixed

- Linker now resolves wikilink-only relationship edits made via the Properties panel. Previously, setting a relationship wikilink (e.g., `dbench-scene: [[Some Scene]]` on a retrofitted draft) without also stamping the ID companion (`dbench-scene-id`) was silently ignored: the linker keys reconciliation off the ID companion, and a wikilink-only edit produced an empty ID, which the reconciler treated as no parent declared. The linker now resolves the wikilink against the candidate-parent pool, backfills the companion via `processFrontMatter`, then proceeds with normal reverse-array reconciliation. Affects all relationships where retrofit leaves a wikilink-empty placeholder: draft -> scene, draft -> chapter, scene -> chapter, scene -> project, chapter -> project. Refs #4.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-29

First BRAT-public release. Ships the full V1 feature set per the [specification](docs/planning/specification.md). API and data shape may still change between minor versions during the 0.x phase; see [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

### Added

**Note types and data model**

- Five plugin-managed note types: `project`, `chapter`, `scene`, `draft`, `compile-preset`. Each carries `dbench-` frontmatter properties identifying its type, identity, and relationships.
- Stable identifiers (`dbench-id`) in the `abc-123-def-456` format, stamped at creation, never changed. Used by the linker as a rename-safe reference target.
- Typed forward relationships (`dbench-project`, `dbench-chapter`, `dbench-scene`) with stable-ID companions, dual-stored as wikilinks + IDs.
- Reverse arrays (`dbench-scenes`, `dbench-chapters`, `dbench-drafts`, `dbench-compile-presets`) maintained by the linker.

**Project shapes**

- Folder projects (default): a project note plus child scenes and drafts in a configurable subfolder.
- Single-scene projects (`dbench-project-shape: single`): a single note that is the whole project.
- Chapter-aware folder projects: a two-level project -> chapter -> scene shape, optional per project. No-mixed-children invariant enforced.
- Frontmatter-based discovery: notes are identified by frontmatter, not folder location. Move notes anywhere in the vault without breaking membership.

**Manuscript view (dockable workspace leaf)**

- Project picker and project-summary section (status, identifier, total word count, hero progress bar when `dbench-target-words` is set, per-status breakdown counting both scenes and chapters).
- Chapter cards (chapter-aware projects): collapsible headers with chevron + order capsule + clickable title + status chip + word-count rollup + "New draft of this chapter" button. Smooth collapse/expand animation. Persisted collapse state per chapter.
- Scene rows: order capsule + title + optional `dbench-subtitle` second line + status chip + word count + draft count.
- Wikilink-style title affordances: cmd/ctrl-click for new tab, +shift for split, +alt for new window, middle-click for new tab, right-click context menu.
- Active-note-sync: opening any plugin-managed note auto-switches the leaf's selected project.
- Toolbar with New scene, New draft, Reorder scenes; primary Compile CTA above the toolbar.

**Manuscript Builder (compile modal)**

- Compile-preset editor with five collapsible sections: Metadata, Inclusion, Output, Content handling, Last compile.
- Preset picker dropdown + "+ New preset" button.
- Run compile button that runs the active preset end-to-end.

**Compile pipeline**

- Markdown intermediate with always-on rules (footnote renumbering, callout strip, etc.) plus per-preset content-handling overrides for heading scope, frontmatter handling, wikilinks, embeds, and dinkuses.
- Heading scopes: `full`, `draft`, `chapter` (chapter-aware compile with two-level walking).
- Output formats: Markdown (vault or disk), ODT, PDF, DOCX.
- Per-scene section breaks via `dbench-section-break-title` with `visual` or `page-break` rendering hint.
- Strip-with-notice batching for filtered embeds (images, audio, video, PDFs, Bases, note embeds).
- Auto-default heading scope based on project shape (chapter-aware projects get `chapter`, chapter-less get `draft`).

**Drafts**

- Scene drafts: snapshot a scene's body to a new file in the configured drafts folder.
- Chapter drafts: snapshot the chapter body plus each child scene's body, concatenated in `dbench-order` with `<!-- scene: <basename> -->` HTML-comment scene boundaries.
- Single-scene-project drafts.
- Three drafts-folder placement modes: project-local (default), per-scene/parent, vault-wide.

**Templates**

- Built-in scene template and chapter template, auto-seeded as `<templatesFolder>/scene-template.md` and `chapter-template.md` on first creation.
- Plugin-token substitution: `{{project}}`, `{{project_title}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{scene_title}}` / `{{chapter_title}}`, `{{scene_order}}` / `{{chapter_order}}`, `{{previous_scene_title}}` / `{{previous_chapter_title}}`.
- Templater plugin pass-through (auto-detected; runs Templater syntax on templates before plugin-token substitution).
- Multi-template support: any markdown file in the templates folder with `dbench-template-type: scene | chapter` frontmatter is discovered and surfaced in the new-scene / new-chapter modal's template picker.

**Linker and integrity service**

- `DraftBenchLinker`: live sync service maintaining bidirectional references on `vault.on('modify')` events through `metadataCache.on('changed')`.
- `DraftBenchIntegrityService` with batch scan and repair via `Repair project links` command. 14 SNAKE_CASE issue codes covering missing reverse entries, stale entries, wikilink/id conflicts (manual review only), and the `PROJECT_MIXED_CHILDREN` invariant.
- Suspended states for plugin-driven multi-file operations to avoid intermediate-state sync.

**Retrofit actions**

- "Set as project / chapter / scene / draft" (idempotent, never overwrites existing values).
- "Complete essential properties" (fills in only missing fields on partially-typed notes).
- "Add identifier" (standalone ID stamp).
- Folder-based inference: when a folder context unambiguously implies a parent project, retrofit actions auto-fill the project ref and order.
- Single-file, multi-select, and folder scopes via context menu.

**Settings**

- Folders: project, chapter, scene, drafts (with placement modes).
- Templates folder + per-type override paths.
- Configurable status vocabulary (idea / draft / revision / final by default).
- Bases starter views folder.
- Bidirectional sync toggles (master + per-event).
- Folder-path autocomplete via `FileSuggest`.

**Bases integration**

- `Draft Bench: Install starter Bases views` palette command. Generates `.base` files at the configured folder for projects, scenes, and drafts.

**Style Settings integration**

- Scene + draft typography variables (font family, size, line height, max width, background, text color).
- Draft-leaf archival cue (border-left, default `3px solid var(--text-faint)`).
- Plugin-managed CSS classes (`.dbench-project`, `.dbench-chapter`, `.dbench-scene`, `.dbench-draft` plus `.draft-bench-*` long-form variants) applied to active editor leaves.

**Onboarding**

- Welcome modal: single screen with brand mark, pitch paragraphs, three CTAs (Create your first project / Try with an example project / Show the manuscript view), wiki link in footer. Auto-shown once per vault; resurfaceable via palette.
- Example project generator (`Example - The Last Lighthouse`): three scenes with prose, one prior draft snapshot, a compile preset.
- First-project auto-reveal: the Manuscript view auto-reveals after a writer's first project creation.

**Reordering**

- Reorder scenes modal with drag handles and keyboard navigation.
- Reorder chapters in project modal (parallel implementation).
- Move scene to chapter context menu action (single-file scope; bulk multi-select is post-V1).

**Commands**

- ~25 palette commands under the `Draft Bench:` prefix covering creation, drafts, reordering, compile, retrofit, repair, and view management. Suggested-hotkeys list in the README.

### Changed

- Frontmatter and CSS short-prefix finalized as `dbench-` (from an earlier `db-` that was ambiguous with "database").
- Planning specification renamed from `SPEC.md` to `specification.md` (kebab-case convention).

### Notes

- Tests: 896 unit + integration tests, all green at release.
- Bundle: ~5.7 MB `main.js` (includes pdfmake + docx). Lazy-loading for the heavy renderers is the top post-V1 bundle-size lever; tracked in [post-v1-forward-compat-audit.md](docs/planning/post-v1-forward-compat-audit.md).
- Platform: desktop-only (`isDesktopOnly: true`). Mobile re-evaluation is post-V1.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- Initial project scaffolding (configs, stubs, MIT license).
- Coding standards document.
- Build, lint, and deploy pipeline verified end-to-end.
- Plugin renamed from "Drafting Table" to "Draft Bench."
